## 🚀 What is it?

This is a simple **RAT (Remote Access Tool)** focused on testing and learning in local networks.  
Ideal for experiments, pranks (with permission), and studying remote control concepts.

---

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Real-time screen streaming (localhost only)
- ✅ Simple interface using WinForms
- ✅ Remote mouse and keyboard control
- ✅ TCP-based communication
- ✅ Lightweight and functional

## 🛠️ How to use

1. **Run the server first** (on the machine to be controlled)
2. Then, **run the client** (on the machine that will control)
3. Both must run on the **same machine** (localhost)

---

## 🎯 Enabling remote control

To **enable mouse and keyboard control**, **press the `K` key** in the server window.  
⚠️ Until you press `K`, the client will only be able to view the screen — no control.
